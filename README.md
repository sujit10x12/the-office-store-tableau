This is a sales analytics project. In which I conducted an analysis on sales of an e-commerce company by examining product sales across different U.S. states from 2016 to 2019.

## Objective
In this project my primary focus is on to analyze the performance of different products category and subcategory over the time and also find most profitable states.

## Questions (KPIs)
-  Topline summary showing high level numbers (ex. Orders, Salesâ€¦etc)
-  Sales by Product Category and SubCategory
-  Performance Over Time by Category
-  Most and least profitable accounts(customers)
-  Shipping preferences by SubCategory
-  Performance by region
-  Top states by sales
-  Top selling products
-  Table showing performance by state

## Data Pre-Processing & Data Cleaning
- Since dataset is ready to use it doesn't require any pre-processing before doing visualization althoug I have done some basic cleaning in Tableau and join fact tables to dimension tables to extract extra information.
